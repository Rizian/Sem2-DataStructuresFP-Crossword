Hello Ms.Nurul, this is our group's repository for the DataStructures Final Project.

- **The FP Folder contains the code for the CLI Wordle, and that is the final submission.**\
- **The Wordle Folder contains the failed GUI attempt for the Wordle Game.**\
- **Report Docs Link:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DPEXqP6Vgp--mjxypVEGB9M5b4e19_gskGSTFV-WiUQ/edit#

**Post-Presentation Updates:**\
After the Final Project presentation, we made some updates on our CLI Wordle program in which we added a Linked List implementation in addition to the array based one we used previously. Other than that we also added a timer using chrono in order to measure the time both implementations take to do the main processing of our Wordle game, which is the error checking. And last but not least we managed to fix our answer key randomizer which now allow players to get a different keyword everytime they run the game.
